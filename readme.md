`npm install loeb`

to think about:

- [x] layouts/wrappers
- [x] slugs/output paths
- [x] assets & public files
- [x] dev server
- [x] command line arguments
- [ ] more plugins
  - [x] CSS (modules? styled-components)
- [x] data/promises
- [x] dynamically generated pages
- [ ] cleaning up old cache/site files
  - [ ] clean-webpack-plugin
- [x] rearchitect
  - [x] use HtmlWebpackPlugin or roll your own (probably) to generate the HTML and just become a webpack plugin/config plugin munger
- [ ] separate named chunks for server/build bundle and clientside
- [ ] HMR
